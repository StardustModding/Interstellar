/**
 * Interstellar relies on a few components:
 *
 * <li>Interstellar (API): The base API module for all abstract functions relating to the mod (like registries, interfaces, etc.).</li>
 * <li>Ion Engine: An abstract and modern energy API built for Interstellar that is easy to use and packs a ton of functionality.</li>
 * <li>Sky Engine: A fully custom physics engine built for Interstellar that handles collisions, velocity, acceleration, drag, and force for opted-in entities, and provides a basic pressure/fluid simulation implementation.</li>
 * <li>Quantum Engine: An abstract and modern machine API handling everything from item inputs and outputs, energy and fluid transfer, GUIs (a GUI framework), custom recipes, and machine inventories.</li>
